-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS-

1.) download the zip file, and if your antivirus gives you lip just tell it let to the zip file through, it brings up a lot of false positives because it downloads stuff from the internet and the .exe file was rather poorly and hastily compiled by pyinstaller. 

2.) put the zip file in the installation location of your choice (I personally reccomend your desktop), and extract it

3.) run the exe file. windows defender is going to be pissed at you, click "more info" and then "run anyway"

-USAGE MANUAL-

The box at the top of the window labeled "download location" displays where your audio files will be downloaded, you can change this with the browse button

The big box on the right is the queue, you add songs to it by putting their name and optionally their artist in the respectively labelled fields on the left, and pressing the enter key or clicking the enter button

you can download the top item in the queue with the "download top item button", or you can download the entire queue with "download all"

the download process can take on average between 30 seconds to 2 minutes per song, deending on song length and internet connection

If it freezes or a song that is not very long is taking forever to download close the program and restart it. If frozen it is not going to unfreeze, and if a song is taking way too long to download something probably went screwy
